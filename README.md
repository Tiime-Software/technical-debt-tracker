# Technical debt tracker

> As with monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate 'interest', making it harder to implement changes.

## üêøÔ∏è In a nutshell
Use PHP annotations _(docblocks annotations)_ to monitor your technical debt.
```php
/**
  * @TechnicalDebt(
  *     categories={"coupled", "Lack of test"}, 
  *     reporter="Flavien Rodrigues", 
  *     description="Lorem ipsum sit dolor amet"
  * )
  */
class DummyService
{
    // ...
}
```
Then run our script as CI step and record the result into your monitoring tool.
